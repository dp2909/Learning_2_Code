# Add Strings
# Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum
#   of num1 and num2. YOU MAY NOT CONVERT THE INPUTS TO INTEGERS by casting them as int
#   example of what you cannot do: int(num1) + int(num2)
#   You must use a different approach.
# Notes:
# Both num1 and num2 contain only digits 0-9.
# Both num1 and num2 do not contain leading 0

num1 = '364'
num2 = '1836'

def solution(num1, num2):
    # Your code goes here
    
print(solution(num1, num2))# 2200
