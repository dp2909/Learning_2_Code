# Easy Algo problems - STRING MANIPULATION

In this week's exercise, you'll practice 2 things: Checking out to your own branch, off of the week1 branch, while also solving some easy algo problems.

Easy is relative, so don't worry if these take some time. When I see easy, I just mean in terms of things you will need to solve for an interview. We will discuss solutions and even work through them together if needed. I also don't know your current level of python proficiency, so this will help me get a better feel.

The name of this document can be used as a hint for how you should approach most of these.

## Notes for problems:

1. These are designed to test your skill. Remember, in a coding interview, you will not be able to use the internet, so try to do these with minimal googling. If you get stuck, feel free to google.
2. There are **optimal** solutions. Meaning, there are multiple ways to solve these, some may just be more efficient than others. Solve them first, and then try to see if you can solve them in a more efficient way. If not, that is good! I will reiterate this later, but don't spend too much time on an individual problem. If you've solved it, that's great. Move on. I will let you know if the approach you took is efficient, or not.
3. Rework the problems. In order to pass an interview, this stuff needs to be done from memory. The only way to commit it to memory is by repetition. Rework these problems so much that you can do them without the internet.
4. Don't get frustrated, and don't spend too long on an individual problem. If you do get stuck on 1, there are 10 so feel free to move to another one and come back.
5. Have fun! You are growing by doing these. Whether they are easy or hard, you are increasing your skill, and that will pay off. Keep at it and good things will come!

## Problem structure:

For the problems, I will provide some text for the clarity, and some input data, as well as the expected answer.

An example will look like this:

```python

# Pass a string to a function and print it

def solution(x):
  # Your code goes here

print(solution('hi')) # should print "hi" to the console
```

Good luck, and have fun! The example exercises will each be their own file, open it, fill in the function, and run it until you see the answer you expect.
